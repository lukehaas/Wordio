CORDOVA
——————————————
Steps so far
setup dir structure
install cordova globally : sudo npm install -g cordova

create the app(creates a dir called build): cordova create build com.build.wordio Wordio

all further cordova commands are run from build dir

add platforms such as android, iOS - these SDKs need to already be installed on machine

add prefs to config.xml

run: cordova build <platform>
